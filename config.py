"""Project-wide constants: filesystem paths, category names, database filename.

Responsible for: the single place every other module reads paths and the
category list from, so nothing hardcodes a directory or a category string.

Inputs: none — this module holds literals only, no logic and no environment
reads.

Outputs: path constants for the data, model and database locations; the 8
category names used by the classifier; the database filename.

How I'll know it works: every module imports its paths and categories from
here, and changing a path in this file changes it everywhere.
